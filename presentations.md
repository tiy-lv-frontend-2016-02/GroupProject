## Presentations

The group will get up collectively and show their work on the screens. Each person in the group will talk through the following:

1. What role did you play in the project?
2. What was the hardest thing you overcame?
3. What was something you struggled with that you had to pass off or seek help with?
4. From your point of view, talk about the problem solving process your team took.

Each person should plan to talk for around 3 minutes. So around 12 - 15 minutes total. 

Be proud of the work that you did, and avoid pointing out things you didn't get to work properly. Also, feel free to talk about what else you would have done if you had more time.
